# Treehouse-FullStackJavaScript-Project-01
# Random Quote Generator
This is a random quote generator. The provided button will allow a user to manually
view a new quote. However, the quote will also changed automatically every 30 seconds.

The background color changes to a randomized color when a new quote is presented, and
quotes contain additional information that can be used for future iterations of the
application.
